## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-20260919-2] - 2026-09-19

This macOS application revision keeps the App version at `0.1.0` and uses a
date-suffixed tag to distinguish distributable builds. The Rust workspace and
the KM003C 23-column recording contract remain compatible.

### Added

- A dedicated record manager for recoverable sessions and KM003C on-device
  recordings, with fixed action columns and stable selection after refresh.
- Export dispatch based on the active source: live data, on-device logs, or an
  unchanged copy of an imported CSV/Parquet file with its metadata sidecar.
- A read-only offline snapshot example and a dated UI/offline acceptance record.

### Changed

- Simplified settings navigation into shorter bilingual categories and moved
  record management out of the configuration pages.
- Kept the current source, quality information, and export controls aligned
  when switching between live, on-device, and imported data.
- Adjusted the monitor layout, chart height reservation, labels, and compact
  controls so language changes and long filenames do not push controls out of
  the window.

### Fixed

- Offline catalog refresh now preserves the selected filename and data offset,
  falling back to the first entry only when the previous entry disappears.
- A failed offline download clears the previous offline view and export source,
  preventing an earlier log from being exported as the new selection.
- Endpoint totals that differ only by a bounded rounding/final-interval tail
  are accepted without changing or fabricating raw samples.
- Imported recordings can be returned to live measurements without leaving a
  stale chart source or allowing an overwrite of the original file.

### Validation

- `cargo test --locked`: 99 GUI tests passed, 3 hardware/external-artifact
  tests ignored, and all library/integration tests passed.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, strict Clippy, Universal App, DMG, and ad-hoc
  signature checks passed.
- Latest DMG SHA-256:
  `5505f1f6f8606a952b6c2223316a1c39b32d174f4b545eab28d1d68e74dd077c`.

The release is published as
[`v0.1.0-20260919-2`](https://github.com/weixunkkkkk/km003c-workbench-macos/releases/tag/v0.1.0-20260919-2).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Shared stateful USB PD decoding, including chunked EPR messages.
- Typed offline-log catalogs and samples, including high-level encrypted
  downloads and final-accumulator validation.
- `offline-log` CLI with metadata inspection and CSV/JSON export.
- Explicit-rate AdcQueue decoding in Python through
  `AdcQueueRawData.decode()` and `parse_packet_with_graph_rate()`.
- Level-2 calibration authentication through
  `KM003C::authenticate_calibration()`.
- `AuthCredential` distinguishes the StreamingAuth credential from a device
  `HardwareId`.
- Lossless, CRC-validated, read-only Settings parsing with typed accessors for
  firmware-confirmed fields and `KM003C::request_settings()`.
- Typed firmware PD state traces, including confirmed Type-C and
  protocol-engine events.
- Configurable GUI plots for voltage, signed and absolute current/power,
  charge, energy, CC1/CC2, and D+/D-.
- GUI recording and plot-buffer export to Parquet or CSV, with missing-sample
  quality data and separate signed net and positive-throughput accumulators.
- A combined GUI timeline for wire-level USB PD messages and firmware state
  traces, with independent filters for both sources.
- GUI browsing, download, plotting, and Parquet/CSV export for recordings
  stored on the KM003C.

### Changed

- `Packet::StreamingAuth` and its Python dictionary representation now name
  their 12-byte value `credential` instead of incorrectly assuming it is
  always a HardwareID.
- Context-free AdcQueue parsing now returns `AdcQueueRawData`; use
  `decode(GraphSampleRate)` when the `StartGraph` rate is known.
- `AdcQueueData` stores its configured `rate`, and
  `has_dropped_samples()` uses that rate directly.
- `AdcDataSimple::sample_rate` is now `Option<SampleRate>` so unknown wire
  indices are not misreported as 2 SPS. The original index is available as
  `sample_rate_raw`.
- `KM003C::read_memory_block()` returns exactly the requested number of bytes
  instead of exposing AES block padding.
- The Python package version is derived from the Rust crate version.
- PD status and event measurements share one representation, and the stateful
  decoder resets negotiation state on connection changes.
- The GUI distinguishes signed charge/energy from positive transferred totals
  and excludes duplicate, stale, and invalid-sequence samples from integration.

### Fixed

- Multi-transfer and non-block-aligned memory reads.
- Lossless ADC and AdcQueue parsing, including marker, flags, and unknown rates.
- PD timestamps, connection-state resets, and connection-status stability.
- Semantic round-trips for authentication and protocol packets.
- StartGraph validation when StreamingAuth does not grant AdcQueue access.
- StreamingAuth response decoding now preserves firmware auth levels 0, 1,
  and 2 instead of treating the level field as a Boolean flag.
- Parsing of populated zero-count firmware trace responses.
- Debounced GUI Type-C connection state during attach and detach transitions.

### Removed

- `KM003C::receive_memory_read_data()` and the synthetic
  `Packet::MemoryReadResponse` variant. Use `KM003C::read_memory_block()` for
  correlated device reads, or `auth::decrypt_memory_read_response()` for
  captured ciphertext.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Type-safe `uom` quantities for measurements, timestamps, and sample rates.
- Correlated USB request/response handling and complete bulk-frame reads.
- Recorded-capture tests for ADC, AdcQueue, authentication, and PD events.
- Cross-platform CI, MSRV checks, and Python binding validation.
- A single Rust 1.97 minimum supported version for the workspace.

### Fixed

- Rate-dependent AdcQueue scaling for CC1, CC2, D+, and D- measurements.
- Streaming-rate reporting now uses the device sequence clock.
- Validation of memory-read confirmations and streaming-auth failures.
- Parsing of chained AdcQueue/PD responses and legacy PD connection events.
